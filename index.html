		<div class="about">
			<p>I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from Oregon State University. For the last couple years, I worked as a journalist at the <a href="http://www.journalstar.com">Lincoln Journal Star</a>, the <a href="http://www.omaha.com">Omaha World-Herald</a> and <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com">The Oregonian</a>. Now, I'm interested in technology and software development.</p>

						<a href="http://webcrawlerapi.appspot.com">
						<h3 class="title">Graphical Web Crawler</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/crawler.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">I designed and built a graphical web crawler application with two classmates for a Software Projects course. The user enters a starting URL, as well as the number of links they wish to crawl, and hits submit. The application then returns a tree-like visualization of the crawl path.</p>
						<p class="explain">The crawler was built using Python, and the front-end visualization was built using <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>. The application was built on top of the Google App Engine.</p>

						<a href="http://bbbllc-1378.appspot.com">
						<h3 class="title">Business Jargon Website</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/business.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">This site was an experiment in working with Parallax.js and ScrollReveal.js. The site, built on the Google App Engine, also makes heavy use of Bootstrap. The project was adapted from the <a href="http://pooperapp.com">Pooper App</a>, a fake app that has a really sleek web design. I wanted to see how it worked, so I created this site for a fake business, BBB LLC, and filled the sections with business jargon. </p>

					<div class="item">
						<a href="http://bames-assignment-two-1361.appspot.com/">
						<h3 class="title">Workout Tracker</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/workout2.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">For a mobile and cloud computing class, I created this simple workout tracker application to test out the Google Datastore NoSQL database. The user is able to add a workout routine, view their routines and edit individual routines easily. </p>
						<p class="explain">The application was built with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and Python, on top of the Google App Engine.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<a href="https://twitter.com/stclairbus">
						<h3 class="title">Twitter Bot</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/twitterbot.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">This twitter bot represents the bus stop near my apartment in Portland, and tweets when the 15 and 20 bus lines are arriving. The bot was built with Python and the <a href="http://www.tweepy.org">Tweepy</a> library, using an API ran by my transit agency,<a href="http://trimet.org"> TriMet</a>. The bot runs on Heroku. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<a href="election.jpg">
						<h3 class="title">Election Map</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/election.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">I created a state-level election map, as well as a how to guide, using <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet.js</a>. I love data and maps, so Leaflet.js was a very interesting library to learn about. The assignment called for the library to be intended for mobile use, so I tried hard to manipulate the Leaflet.js library into some mobile friendly. As a result, the user must tap and hold onto a state in order to see the election data. </p>

						<a href="https://github.com/mbamesb2/Usability-Design/blob/34cc6c6115528dfad988baaf80873fb6b82d4e9e/CS352_Fall2015_Team_10.pdf">
						<h3 class="title">Usability: Point of Sale App</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/pos.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">Using prototyping tool <a href="http://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a>, a group of classmates and I created a wireframe for a check-splitting app to be used by both diners and restaurants. The version of the app used by diners would allow them to split their bill with other diners as they wish, as well as add a tip, with a few taps. We focused on making the application quick, easy to use and usable.</p>

					<div class="item">
						<a href="https://github.com/mbamesb2/Database-Presidential/blob/master/dbActions.js">
						<h3 class="title">Usability: Point of Sale App</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/database.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">For a databases course, I designed a SQL relational database for biographical presidential data. For the project, I created an ER diagram, a schema, a list of table creation queries and a simple application built with AJAX, node.js and HTML to allow a user to add data to the database.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<a href="https://mbamesb2.github.io/angularTest/#/inbox">
						<h3 class="title">Angular.js Inbox</h3>
						<img src="/static/img/inbox.jpg">
						</a>
						<p class="explain">After reading up on Angular.js, I decided to create a tutorial app, authored by Thinkful.com, to get the hang of the syntax. This inbox application draws email messages from a JSON file, and allows the user to read and delete the messages. </p>
